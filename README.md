this repo is where i put my resume.

i made it with HTML + CSS so i could position things how i wanted and so i could use emoji ðŸ˜‡

this is a next.js project purely for a fast DX but it doesn't really need all that.

if you'd like to use this:

1. clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. run the dev server with `npm run dev`
4. print the page in chrome --> save to PDF

> this is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
